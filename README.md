# README Generator

## Description

This project was built in order to easily make any sort of README markdown file that has a professional look to it. While making this project I learned how to better manipulate and navigate the terminal to my advantage.

## Installation

In order to run the program, you'll first have to fork the repo. In the terminal you'll run npm install to install all dependencies.

## Usage

While in the project's root folder, in the terminal, you'll type

    node index.js

and you'll be prompted with a series of questions for user input. The user's input is what will be generated to the new markdown file.
